# "I.S.A.C."
####"I.S.A.C." - "Intelligent System Analytic Computer"

"I.S.A.C." - "Intelligent System Analytic Computer" from the "Tom Clancy's The Division", in this project I have done
(or I am doing) something similar to it using various libraries such as Adafruit and will be built on a Raspberry Pi
computer in the Python programming language. Its functions include temperature detection, battle mode, case backlight
control, emergency mode, various simplifications for your life in the form of a voice assistant, which can be like a
calculator that can play any game with you, etc.
